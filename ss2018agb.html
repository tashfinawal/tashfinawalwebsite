    Assemble, OriGinal Alexander Graham Bell + a Delicious back (OGAGBD)!

    GUIDELINES
    </h2>
    
<p class="guidelines">
    Here are the guidelines that we brainstormed and agreed upon as a group (relatively)
    <ul class="guidelines">
        <li>Cost of gift should be <b>$10</b>, max $20 including tax
        <li><b>Creativity > Costliness;</b> try to make the gift more meaningful/sentimental and less about the money that went into it</li>
        <li><b>No wishlists</b>; the recieving party should be not only surprised of who their Santa is, but what they are recieving</li>
        <li>Gifts cannot have been purchased with <b>Brazio</b>, which is <i>Brazil's Cryptocurrency </i>(because it's worthless) </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

<p>
    Do you have the 5-digit Christmas Code that Tashfin gave you? If so, please enter it below! If not, please ask Tashfin for your unique Christmas Code that will unlock who you are the Secret Santa for! 
    </p>
<button type="button" onclick="revelation()">Click here to reveal your fate</button>

<p class="note"><i> 
    Note: If the prompt terminates before giving the answer that you seek, it is most likely because you either entered the wrong number, Tashfin gave you the wrong number, or there is a bug in the system. Please let Tashfin know ASAP.
    </i></p>

<h5>
    For those who are curious about the source code, you can find them in a repository here:
    </h5>
    <p class="github">
    <a href="https://github.com/tashfinawal/tashfinawalwebsite">Github</a>
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        Also, along with the repository that has all the source code and back-end code, there will be <u>a wiki that explains the story behind my code.</u> I've made this wiki basic enough so that you nignogs that don't have much technical experience can still understand it, while it references enough 'computer-science only' things so that it's enriched reading regardless of your background. Have fun!
