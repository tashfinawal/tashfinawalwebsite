## Welcome to the official respository for Tashfin's website
The Wiki will help guide you through what some of the code means, however feel free to contact and ask how some stuff works.
All the material in this repository is free for personal use, however, please contact me for the business use of the contents of this repository.
## Technical
To run the website, you will need a valid HTML intepreter, which most, if not all, machines have, especially if you are accessing this ReadMe file from the internet. Most, if not all, web browsers should do the trick.
To edit and play with the website you'll need an HTML editor, however basic editors like your native Text Editor should be just fine, so long as you can preview the changes you make afterwards through the HTML intepreter that I mentioned earlier. 
To run the Python files, you will need a valid Python Intepretor, which can be easily downloaded for free from the internet.
The Python files could also be edited with generic Text Editor, although a Python/Programming Editor would be better recommended.
Most of the programs that I listed as requirements often come bundled, so a Python Editor can double as an intepretor, and there are some programs that can handle HTML and Python at once, and I suggest you research further into these, as they are free or available for purchase.
The size of this repository is approximately 333KB.
