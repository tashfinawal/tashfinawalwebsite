<p><b>A Brief Overview</b></p>
<p>So the reason the change log was moved from the homepage to here is quite obvious; because it was <i>impractical.</i> Constantly having to update an ever-growing change log would have been cumbersome and waste of resources, especially when Github better denotes the changes and better visualizes it for maximum transparency. Plus, the advantage of having Github do it automatically for free is too good for lazy coders like me to pass on.</p>
<p>Yet still, a sentimental part of me thought it important to preserve the baby steps of what was once a simple landing page with very few changes, as it's now growing into a host of projects that I can't wait to share with my friends and the world. So be sure to check in time to time and see what's new on the website and also review the changes on Github if you're ever curious about how things went down.</p>
